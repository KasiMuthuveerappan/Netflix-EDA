## 🏷️Overview
This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) project focusing on Netflix data. 
The goal of this project is to clean the data , unnest the comma seperated columns and treat the missing values , gain insights, visualize trends, and explore patterns within the Netflix dataset. 
I have done a thorough analysis of Netflix's content, user reviews, and other relevant information to uncover interesting findings.

## 📚Dataset
The dataset used for this project can be found in the **"Rawdata"** directory. You can explore and analyze this data to gain a better understanding of Netflix's offerings and user interactions.

## 📝🤔 Exploratory Data Analysis
In this EDA, we've covered a wide range of topics and questions, including but not limited to:

- Analysis of content types (Movies, TV shows)
- Trends in content releases over the years
- User rating distributions
- Genre preferences
- Popular actors and directors
- Correlations
- And more...

The analysis is performed using Python and popular data analysis libraries such as `Numpy`,`Pandas`, `Matplotlib`, and `Seaborn`. 
You can find the cleaned and segregated csv files in the **"Cleaned Data"** directory.
You can find the code and detailed explanations in the Jupyter Notebook files in the **"EDA Analysis"** directory.
